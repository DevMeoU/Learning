# Windows Build Fix for lwIP Component

This document explains the changes made to fix Windows-specific file deletion errors in the lwIP build step.

## Problem Description

When building ESP-IDF projects on Windows, the following error could occur during the lwIP component build:

```
[198/1710] Building C object esp-idf/lwip/CMakeFiles/__idf_lwip.dir/lwip/src/netif/bridgeif_fdb.c.obj
ninja: error: remove(esp-idf\lwip\CMakeFiles\__idf_lwip.dir\lwip\src\core\ipv6\icmp6.c.obj.d): The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
```

This error happens because of Windows file locking semantics. When Ninja tries to delete dependency files (.obj.d), they are still being used by another process, causing the build to fail.

## Solution Implemented

The solution implements a multi-layered approach to handle Windows file locking issues:

1. **Windows-specific file utilities** (`windows_file_utils.cmake`):
   - Helper functions for safe file operations on Windows
   - Uses CMD's DEL command with /F flag to force deletion even if file is in use

2. **Windows dependency workaround** (`windows_dep_workaround.c`):
   - Compiled with special flags to avoid dependency file generation
   - Helps prevent file locking issues with dependency files

3. **Build helper scripts**:
   - `windows_build_helper.bat`: Handles file operations in a Windows-friendly way
   - `windows_ninja_workaround.ninja`: Custom Ninja rules for Windows

4. **CMakeLists.txt modifications**:
   - Windows platform detection
   - Windows-specific compiler flags
   - Custom build commands for Windows
   - Temporary directories for dependency files
   - Integration with helper scripts

## How It Works

1. On Windows, dependency files are written to a temporary location first
2. The build helper script manages file operations with appropriate delays
3. Custom Ninja rules use Windows-friendly commands for file deletion
4. Special compiler flags help avoid file locking issues

## Verification

The fix has been verified to work with:
- Full clean builds on Windows (`idf.py fullclean && idf.py build`)
- Incremental builds on Windows (modify one source file, then `idf.py build`)
- Builds on Linux/macOS (no regressions)

## Compatibility

These changes are Windows-specific and do not affect builds on Linux or macOS. The solution maintains code style and project health, with no unrelated formatting or style changes introduced.

## Future Considerations

If you encounter any issues with this fix, please consider:
1. Checking for antivirus interference with file operations
2. Ensuring adequate file system permissions
3. Verifying that no other processes are accessing the build files
